# CS304_Project
An ML project that aims to develop an algorithm to forecast whether a patient has Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) or not.
One of the main reasons of vision loss in diabetics is diabetic retinopathy (DR). Early detection is very important for successful treatment. This project aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML) system that will be able to forecast whether DR exists or not. The dataset called "Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set",  which has 20 characteristics and 1,151 data entries, will be used. Number of machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Logistic Regression, will be compared in this project. The goal is to determine which approach produces the most dependable model. Cross validation, model training, and extensive data preparation are all part of the project. Based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. At the end we will detect which one is the best.
